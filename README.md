# Social-Network Project

**NetCode** is the name given to my social-network project. Written with React.js and node it was the first big full scale project of the FullStack bootcamp. 


## Tech-Stack

Using Javascript technologies. React for Frontend | Node / express for backend it allowed me to learn about new frontend libraries such as TailwindCSS, Framer-Motion, Redux and oAuth and AWS S3 services.
